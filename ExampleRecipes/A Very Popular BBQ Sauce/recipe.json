I cut the recipe in half for smoked baby back ribs. There's really no need to put this in a blender, just a bowl. I highly recommend putting this on the stove in a saucepan and letting it come to a boil for about one minute. Then take it off the stove and let it cool. This will let it thicken and allow the flavors to come through. If you like a sweeter sauce keep this recipe the same, if not cut back on the sugar. If you're like me and like a smoky BBQ sauce add 1\/2 tsp. of liquid smoke for half the recipe or 1 tsp. for the whole recipe.

It would be foolish to ever buy the store bought kind again. You just can't compare them. This was great! Husband loved it, kids liked it....my 10 year old even put some on the side for dipping. I did exactly what the recipe stated. Also, I don't really think it had a \"kick\" it was sweet and tangy. This is my BBQ sauce for now on. Thanks for sharing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":"1","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"DMB4LIFE","image":"","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.allrecipes.com\/cook\/1207856\/"}},{"@type":"Review","datePublished":"2006-12-12T02:55:26.1Z","reviewBody":"wow this is an extradonary sauce. its great the way it is but if you add my modifications, you will have the greatest bbq suace you have ever had. instead of 1 tbl worcestershire sauce use 1\/2 cup. add 2 cloves of garlic (minced). delete pepper sauce and use 1 teaspoon of ground cayanne pepper.if this isnt the greatest sauce you have ever had let me know.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":"1","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"jereamy","image":"","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.allrecipes.com\/cook\/2045535\/"}},{"@type":"Review","datePublished":"2006-05-08T19:28:30.14Z","reviewBody":"WOW - this is one killer recipe! I think it's unfair for cooks to make half a dozen changes and then rate so I prepared exactly as written and yum yum yum! Some of the best spareribs I've ever prepared.

I chose this one because I had all the ingredients and it sounded good. I scaled it to yield 8 - just the right amount for this meal. I wish I had made more. I followed each measurement exactly and love the result, especially for this. A perfect taste\/texture for an overnight marinade and cooking. Thanks. It's a keeper for sure.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":"1","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"claudygirl","image":"","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.allrecipes.com\/cook\/494115\/"}},{"@type":"Review","datePublished":"2005-04-02T19:44:54.81Z","reviewBody":"This is the BEST BBQ sauce ever! Found this recipe one day when out of bottled sauce, and it was fantastic! I will never buy bottled BBQ sauce again, my family won't let me! I find using a hand mixer is better than the blender, not quite as messy. We now double the recipe when making as it goes so fast in our home. Great on beef, chicken, pork, you name it. We also warm it with a little beer to give it a different flavor. My picky 10 year old loves it too! Try it, you won't regret it!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":"1","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"LADYKC67","image":"","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.allrecipes.com\/cook\/1391049\/"}},{"@type":"Review","datePublished":"2011-05-27T13:34:52.38Z","reviewBody":"Great sauce! I have made this several times now and I feel I have it perfected at least in my mind. I used only 1 cup brown sugar, 1 1\/2 cups ketchup, 1\/4 cup balsamic and 1\/4 cup red wine vinegars, 1\/2 cup beer, 2 1\/2 tablespoons dry mustard, 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, 2 teaspoons sweet Hungarian paprika, 1 teaspoon each of Emerils Bayou Blast, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper and kosher salt. After blending well I simmer it for almost an hour. This is so good on so many different things! If too spicy it can easily be adjusted but the best thing about it is, it is so much cheaper to make this sauce than it is to buy any of them from the store. Try it! You won't be dissapointed. FYI Instead of pizza sauce use this on a pineapple and ham pizza. It'll make your eyes roll back in your head!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":"1","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"morenutty","image":"","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.allrecipes.com\/cook\/4656557\/"}},{"@type":"Review","datePublished":"2005-05-25T18:48:27.247Z","reviewBody":"So at first I didn't really love it, but it was ok. I let it sit over night and the next day I tasted it and it seemed a little better. Well it definitely has grown on me, I love it. My hubby loves it too, and he is very picky about this sort of thing. I will say that it has a little more of a kick to it then I prefer so next time I will use a little less of the dry mustard. No more ketchup for me anymore, I put this stuff on EVERYTHING!!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":"1","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"5"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"ChefAndy","image":"","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.allrecipes.com\/cook\/1427271\/"}},{"@type":"Review","datePublished":"2011-01-31T21:01:48.990Z","reviewBody":"Wow!!
